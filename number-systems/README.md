Do not use any tools or programming to solve these problems. Work it out yourself by hand, and fill in the answers.

Do not convert any binary numbers to decimal when solving a question unless the question explicitly tells you to.

The goal of these exercises is for you to gain an intuition for binary numbers. Using tools to solve the problems defeats the point.

Convert the binary number 101101 to decimal:
Answer: 45

Which is larger: 1000 or 0111?
Answer: 1000 because 1000 = 8 whereas 0111 = 7

Which is larger: 00100 or 01011?
Answer: 01011 because 01011 = 11 whereas 00100 = 4

What is 10101 + 01010?
Answer: ~~32 because 10101 = 21 and 01010 = 10~~ 11111 (31 in decimal)

What is 10001 + 10001?
Answer: ~~34 because 10001 = 17~~ 100010 (34 in decimal)

What's the largest number you can store with 4 bits, if you want to be able to represent the number 0?
Answer: 15; 0b0000

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 255 inclusive?
Answer: 8

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 3 inclusive?
Answer: 2

How many bits would you need in order to store the numbers between 0 and 1000 inclusive?
Answer: 10 (Actual answer: 10, but you'd have 23 spare values, so you can actually store between 0 and 1023 with 10 bits.)

How can you test if a binary number is a power of two (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...)?
Answer: A binary number is a power of two if it has exactly one 1 bit, or equivalently if n & (n - 1) == 0 (for n > 0) (Actual answer: Test that it has exactly one 1.)
